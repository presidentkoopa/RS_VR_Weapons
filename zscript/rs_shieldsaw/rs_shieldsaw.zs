// WEAPON 1 -- THE SHIELD SAW.
//
// Rebuilt, not ported. Rusted Legacy's original was `extend class
// RLOffhandFist`: not a weapon at all, but a mode bolted onto the off-hand
// fist, and it needed DoomWeaponZ, rlvr_Settings, the weapon HUD and the aim
// laser before it would compile. None of that is here. This is a plain
// Weapon on stock GZDoom, it works in either hand, and it is the only thing
// in this mod so far.
//
// HOW IT PLAYS. The shield hangs on a mount over your off shoulder. Reach
// your off hand back, squeeze, and it comes into that hand -- whatever was in
// it is set aside. Attack and the disc grinds what it touches while the same
// sweep paints anything further off. Let go and it flies the painted route,
// cutting each in turn, and returns to the mount; your own weapon is back in
// your hand the instant it leaves. Release at the mount instead and it just
// goes back.
//
// ONE ATTACK INPUT, TWO JOBS. Holding the grip is what keeps the shield in
// your hand, and a grip-held main fire arrives as alt-fire -- so there is
// effectively one attack available. Rather than choose, it grinds and paints
// at once.
//
// THE STATE MACHINE OWNS WHERE THE SHIELD IS, not this file. Nothing in a
// weapon's own state table can tell the difference between "in your hand" and
// "on your back", which is why every attack here asks A_ShieldDrawn first.
//
// WHAT CHANGED FROM THE ORIGINAL, and why:
//
//   * It is a weapon now, not a mode on the fist. The fist should be a fist.
//
//   * The throw locks a LIST. The original auto-aimed at one nearest target
//     inside 30 degrees and then you flew it by looking at things --
//     A_GuideShieldMotion re-aimed it at your view every single tic, so you
//     could not look away from your own shield. Fixing the route at the
//     moment of release frees your head and makes the throw a decision about
//     who dies in what order.
//
//   * Its deflector cleared bReflective when your own shot struck it and
//     NEVER PUT IT BACK, so the first time you fired through your own shield
//     it stopped deflecting for the rest of the level. Tick restores it, and
//     CanCollideWith now stops the collision outright.
//
//   * The seven fixed throw planes (RollOffset 0, +/-30, +/-60, +/-90, chosen
//     by jumping to one of seven spawn states) are one continuous angle now:
//     the wrist's roll at release, held for the whole flight.
//
//   * Motion throw was gated behind the oVRdrive mod being loaded
//     (`shieldMotionThrow = !ovrdrive_loaded ? false : ...`). Dropped rather
//     than carried as a dead dependency on a mod we do not ship.
//
// MODEL FRAMES, read off the meshes rather than guessed:
//   shield.md3     0 closed .. 3 fully open
//   shieldsaw.md3  0 stowed, 1-4 deploying, 5-7 spinning
//   hand.md3       frame 1
// SSAW is the with-hand key, SSNH without. The sprite frames behind them are
// blank 1x1 images and they are LOAD-BEARING: Weapon::TryPickup refuses any
// weapon whose Ready state has no valid sprite frame, so without them the
// weapon compiles, loads, and can never be picked up.

		// machine launches from those args. Zero -- no service on the sender, or no
		// velocity -- flies the aimed line exactly as before. Speed follows the arm

// THE SHIELD ON YOUR BACK, AND REACHING OVER YOUR SHOULDER FOR IT.
//
// This originally replaced the forearm psprite outright. The forearm was the
// wrong mount for two reasons that only showed up in a headset: a shield big
// enough to read as a shield covers the arm you need to see, and -- worse --
// ANY grip squeeze was the draw, so the shield fought RS_Hands for every
// health pack you picked up.
//
// A dedicated anchor fixed both. The draw became a PLACE, not a button: put
// your off hand over your own shoulder and squeeze. Nothing else in the game
// wants that spot, so there is nothing to arbitrate with.
//
// A WORLD ACTOR, NOT A PSPRITE, and that is forced rather than chosen. A
// psprite is drawn in a HAND's frame; there is no hand at your shoulder blade.
// Body-anchored things are world actors here -- it is what RS_Holsters does for
// all nine of its anchors -- and 35Hz placement is fine for something sitting
// on your back that you never look straight at.
//
// rs_ss_mount_mode BRINGS THE FOREARM BACK AS AN OPTION, not a replacement.
// The RS_GripArbiterService's grip.subject check -- added after the forearm
// was scrapped, and what offHandFree() in rs_shieldsaw_state.zs now leans on
// for the shoulder gesture too -- was the piece that was actually missing the
// first time: a grip that closes on nothing (GRIPSUBJ_None) is the gesture, a
// grip that closes on a health pack or a magazine is somebody else's, and the
// arbiter can already tell them apart. With that in place the forearm no
// longer fights RS_Hands for anything. The one cost that survives is the one
// that was never a logic bug: a shield strapped to your own forearm still
// covers the arm you're looking at. RS_ShieldForearmActor below is a
// FollowOffHand world prop -- draw-rate placement, like every other prop that
// rides a moving hand -- rather than the old psprite, and rs_shieldsaw.zs's
// holdDeflector() now places the passive guard at whichever of the two spots
// the shield actually is.

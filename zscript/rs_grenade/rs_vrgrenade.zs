//
// Slot 9. Select it and it is in your hand. Hold that hand's fire to open the
// pin window; take the pin with your opposite hand or with your teeth; swing
// your arm and let go of fire to throw it.
//
// ONE CLASS, NOT TWO. An earlier cut had a "pouch" weapon in slot 9 that
// produced a separate grenade object into your hand through RS_Held -- which
// meant a weapon, an inventory item, a grab-policy workaround and a held-object
// lifecycle all kept in step, every bit of it scaffolding around the fact that
// a slot number belongs to a Weapon. The grenade IS the weapon. What leaves
// your hand is the only other actor, and it exists only once it is in the air.
//
// WHAT THAT BUYS, beyond being smaller:
//   - no RS_GrabPolicy dependency, and no deriving from Inventory to sneak past
//     a hardcoded table with no extension point.
//   - no RS_Held slot to take, hold, release or leak.
//   - which hand it is in is a fact the engine already knows (bOffhandWeapon),
//     not something to track.
//
// STILL BORROWED, because these were solved already:
//   RS_Swing / RS_Throw   the peak of your arm's motion over the last ~180ms,
//                         which is the throw.
//   RS_Reach              palm centre, and the grab oval the opposite hand has
//                         to put on the grenade to take the pin.
